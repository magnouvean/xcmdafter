* xcmdafter
~xcmdafter~ is a simple shell script which runs a command after a
certain time of inactivity. It aims to be a simplified ~xautolock~,
without the limitation of only being able to have one instance running
at the same time

** Usage:
#+begin_src sh
xcmdafter "CMD" TIMEOUT [SLEEP_TIMEOUT]
#+end_src
*** Example:
#+begin_src sh
xcmdafter "xset dpms force off" 10
#+end_src
The example over turns off the screen after 10 seconds of inactivity

*** Example:
#+begin_src sh
xcmdafter "systemctl hibernate" 3600 5
#+end_src
The example over hibernates the computer after ~1~ hour of
inactivity. Here we have specified SLEEP_TIMEOUT to ~5~ seconds which
means we only check for inactivity every ~5~ seconds (default is every
second), which technically should be lighter on system resources

** Installation:
Make sure you have ~xprintidle~ installed. Then simply copy
~xcmdafter~ somewhere in your ~PATH~ and you're ready to go
